# ETL_project_2_Bank_Rating

This project aims to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data related to the market capitalization of the world's largest banks. The extracted data is sourced from Wikipedia and includes information about the top 10 banks by market capitalization. The project then transforms this data by converting market capitalization values into various currencies, such as GBP, EUR, and INR, based on provided exchange rates. Finally, the transformed data is saved both as a CSV file and into an SQLite database for further analysis and querying.
